### About

I found that 2 available generators [Maldon](https://github.com/flood-protocol/maldon) and [AmanRaj](https://github.com/AmanRaj1608/create3/tree/master) does not work well with[ LiFi create3 factory](https://github.com/lifinance/create3-factory/blob/main), since LiFi factory is hashing input salt with msg.sender to mitigate possible frontrun of smart contract deployment under known address, which seems to not be included in those approaches.

### Usage

FACTORY address and PROXY_BYTECODE are default to be compatible with LiFi factory, but you can specify your own.

```sh
Usage: {} <num_threads> <deployer_address> <prefix> [FACTORY | PROXY_BYTECODE]
```

### Example

```sh
